Inside the prison, Andy befriends Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman), an inmate who is known for his ability to smuggle contraband items into the prison. With Red's help, Andy manages to survive the harsh life inside the prison and eventually becomes an integral part of the prison community.<br />
