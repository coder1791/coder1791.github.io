<h1> Steve Jobs on Stay hungry </h1><img src='cover_img.jpg' alt='Cover Image'>
<div class='content'>
Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Inc, is widely known for his inspiring speeches and motivational quotes. One of his famous quotes is "Stay hungry, stay foolish". This quote has become a mantra for many entrepreneurs and individuals who aspire to achieve greatness.<br />
<br />
But what does it really mean to stay hungry? According to Jobs, staying hungry means that we should never be satisfied with what we have achieved. We should always strive for more and keep pushing ourselves to the limit. It's about having a hunger for success, for innovation, and for making a difference in the world.<br />
<br />
Staying foolish, on the other hand, means that we should be willing to take risks and make mistakes. We should not be afraid to try new things and explore uncharted territories. It's about having the courage to think outside the box and challenge conventional wisdom.<br />
<br />
Together, staying hungry and staying foolish can be a powerful combination. It can drive us to achieve things that we never thought were possible. It can help us to overcome obstacles and reach our goals.<br />
<br />
So, if you want to achieve greatness in life, remember Steve Jobs' words and stay hungry, stay foolish. Never stop learning, never stop exploring, and never stop pushing yourself to be the best version of yourself.</div>
